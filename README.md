As this is a class project, I did not write the header files or proj5.cpp files as they were provided as starter code. 
They were still provided because they're necessary for the program.
I wrote all the other .cpp files and I wrote the linked list part of the Queue.cpp. The top half of Queue.cpp with the node template was also provided as starter code.
However, I understand all those parts and I'd be able to code them myself if need be.
